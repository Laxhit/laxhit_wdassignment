		 <h1><b><dd>Re: Eileen Dover university application</dd></b></h1>
		 <p><dd>Dear Eileen,</dd></p>
		 <p><dd>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part<br>
		 of your <u class="a">PhD</u> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</dd></p>
		 <h2><b><dd>Starting dates</dd></b></h2>
		 <p><dd>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you<br>
		 could dart at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</dd></p>
		 <UL STYLE="LIST-STYLE-TYPE:DISC">
			<dd><LI>First semester: 9 September 2016</dd>
			<dd><LI>Second semester: 15 January 2017</dd>
			<dd><LI>Third semester: 2 May 2017</dd>
		</ul>	
		<p><dd>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</dd></p>
		<p><dd>You can find more information about <A HREF="https://www.google.com/search?ei=38piXODJKsrdvgTox4P4Bw&q=important+university+dates&oq=important+university+da&gs_l=psy-ab.1.0.0j0i22i30l9.110142.116234..117778...0.0..0.194.3224.0j23......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i71j35i39j0i131j0i67j0i20i263.RxiccFO1B-0" TARGET="BLANK">important university dates on our website.</A></dd></p>
		<h2><b><dd>Subjects of study</dd></b></h2>
		<p><dd>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility—as long as the subjects fall<br> 
		somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just<br>
		the kind of person we’d like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued<br>
		by are as follows, in order of priority:</dd></p>
		<OL>
			<dd><LI>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub> O<sub>3</sub>.)</dd><br>
			<dd><LI>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the <br>
			 audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 * 10<sup>3</sup>> 3 *10<sup>4</sup>.)</dd><br>
			<dd><LI><u class="a">HTML</u> and <u class="a">CSS</u> constructs for representing musical scores.</dd>
		</OL>	
		<p><dd>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the <br>
			   research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</dd></p>
		<h2><b><dd>Exotic dance moves</dd></b></h2>
		<p><dd>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,<br>
				my favorite dances are as follows, with definitions:</dd></p>
		<p><dd>Polynesian chicken dance<dd><br>
		<dd> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A little known but <i>very</i> influential dance dating back as far as 300<u class="a">BC</u>, a whole village would dance around<br> 
				&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful".</dd></p>
		<p><dd>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dd><br>
		<dd>	&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which<br> 
				&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptably<br>
				&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired<br>
				&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;modern styles such as Twerking.</dd></p>
		<p><dd>Arctic robot dance</dd><br>	
		<dd>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have<br>
				&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants <br>
				&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this <br>
				&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;because they were really cold.</p></dd>
